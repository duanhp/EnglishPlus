Demonstrates how to work with DLLs in UniDAC-based applications. This demo
project includes two projects:
  1) The UniDll project represents a dll containing a form that can send SQL queries 
     to the server and display results of these queries.
  2) UniExe represents a project that uses the UniDll library to work with database.

Note, before testing UniExe, you should build the UniDll project.
